we introduce Virtual Fitness Trainer, an application that detects the user’s exercise pose and provides 
personalized, detailed recommendations on how the user can improve their form. Pose Trainer uses the state of the art in pose
estimation module known as “BlazePose” tool from “MediaPipe” to detect a user’s pose, then evaluates the pose of an exercise to 
provide useful feedback. We record a dataset of over 1000 keypoints coordinate of parts of body in correct and incorrect form, 
based on personal training guidelines, we build a machine learning algorithm for evaluation. AI Trainer works on six common
exercises and supports any Windows or Linux computer with a GPU and a webcam.
